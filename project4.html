						GlowBadge is a badge sharing website created during
						Globalshala hackathon 2.0 organized by HackerEarth. The
						website has an easy to use interface and an API access
						which can be used to send badges. The website also
						includes a file explorer for Badge Handling, a timeline
						for courses and statistics. The project won first place
						in the education category and overall 4th position in
						hackathon.
					</p>
					<h3>Project Context ‚úçüèª</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Open Source</li>
						<li>Team Project</li>
						<li>Hackthon project</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Tools Used üõ†üîé</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>HTML, CSS, JS</li>
						<li>Nodejs</li>
						<li>chart.js</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 class="extra-highlight">How To Use :</h3>
					<p>
						The use of this website is pretty simple. First you have
						to sign-up or sign-in. You have 2 options for that,
						either you can login as badge distributor or badge
						receiver. If you sign-in as badge distributor you will
						see 3 sections, client console, client timelines or
						client statistics. If you sign-in as badge receiver you
						will see 2 sections, your badges and your timelines.
					</p>
					<h3 class="extra-highlight">Client Login :</h3>
					<p>
						In the client console you will get access to a fully
						featured file explorer where you can store your badges.
						In the right section of file explorer you will see two
						boxes where you can either use direct share or you see
						the API call for a particular badge. In the timeline
						section you can create a timeline for your organization.
						For example, a school can create English timeline which
						will be represented in the badge order for english
						timeline. Client statistics are created to show badge
						statistics to a client.
					</p>

					<h3 class="extra-highlight">User Login :</h3>
					<p>
						In the student console you will see all the badges you
						have received till now. When you click on a badge a
						model will open which will show you badge details and a
						unique qr code for that badge to verify it. In the
						student timeline you will see 2 sections, subscribed
						timelines and all timelines. All timelines include
						timelines created by any of the clients who gave you a
						minimum of 1 badge. You can see information about each
						timeline like who this is for, when it is created and if
						you like it then you can subscribe to it. In the
						subscribed timeline you will see your progress like how
						many badges have you received from 1 timeline, how many
						are left, which is the next badge etc.
					</p>

					<h3 class="extra-highlight">Where it can be improved :</h3>
					<p>
						This website was created during a hackathon in a very
						small timeframe so there are some features here and
						there that are just dummy or not working. But I have no
						plan to work on it in the near future or to take it into
						production. The code is available on github if you want
						to use it or want to work on some open source.
					</p>

					<h3 class="extra-highlight">Where it can be used :</h3>
					<p>
						This website although not in production can be used in
						schools, collages or any other organization to celebrate
						someone's achievement especially during this post covid
						era.
