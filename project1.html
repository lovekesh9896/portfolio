					<p class="one-project-intro">
						This website can create a recursion tree of any java
						code. And not just a recursion tree it can also help one
						visualize how to function calling works in java code. On
						this page, I am going to explain the project. You can
						either watch the video for the demo or study the project
						below.
					</p>
					<h3>Project Context ‚úçüèª</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Open Source</li>
						<li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
						<li>Java</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Tools Used üõ†üîé</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>HTML, CSS, js</li>
						<li>Nodejs</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 class="extra-highlight">How To Use :</h3>
					<p>
						In the left sanction there is ‚ÄúHow to use‚Äù, ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù,
						and ‚ÄúContribution‚Äù guide of the website. In the
						top-right section, there are some social buttons and a
						theme change dropdown for the editor themes. Below that,
						we have the code editor and then there are 2 buttons for
						custom input and submit code.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use the website just paste your java code in the
						editor, put custom input if any, and then click submit.
						Then the website will take some time to analyze the code
						and create a JSON object for its function calling. It
						will copy the code to your clipboard and open another
						website
						<a href="https://vanya.jp.net/vtree/"
							>vanya.jp.net/tree</a
						>
						.Paste your clipboard content in the text area and your
						recursion tree is ready. It uses another website for
						JSON tree view. I will talk about it again at the end of
						the video.
					</p>

					<h3 class="extra-highlight">How it works :</h3>
					<p>
						For a detailed code explanation please see my other
						video from the description below, here I will explain
						just the basics of how the code works. First when you
						enter your code in the editor and press submit the
						website will send the code to the backend. The backend
						of the website is created with nodejs. First, the code
						will be run once and checked for runtime and syntax
						errors. If there is a problem it will send an error
						message to the frontend. If there is no problem then we
						will start to change the code. We will add print
						statements to all the functions using string
						manipulation and another ds like the stack. We will add
						print statements to the start of function and end of
						every function like just before the return or when the
						function is ended. Then we will run the code again and
						copy the output of our new code. It will look something
						like this. Then we will create the JSON object from this
						out and send it to the frontend. The object is then
						copied to the clipboard and a new website will be opened
						where you paste your code for tree view.
					</p>

					<h3 class="extra-highlight">Where it can be improved :</h3>
					<p>
						If you are interested in contributing to the project you
						are most welcome. The website can be improved on both
						the front end and back end. Detailed instruction on how
						to start the project is available on Github and the link
						to Github is in the description. Just use the website,
						if you think you can improve in anything open an issue
						and start working on it. From my side, first I would
						love to add support for other languages. So if you know
						any other language and nodejs (or just js) you can add
						support for that language. Some websites already create
						recursion trees for python but their functionality is
						also limited. There are also some edge cases where code
						fails to add extra statements like when the user doesn‚Äôt
						use curly brackets for if-else statements and adds a
						return statement and when the main function is not the
						last, etc. In the front end, I think adding our tree
						view will be great. I am already working on it but if
						you have any other ideas you are welcome to contribute.
					</p>

					<h3 class="extra-highlight">
						How is it different from other websites :
					</h3>
					<p>
						There are some websites which create recursion trees of
						python code with much more beautiful animations but
						working is very limited. Either they work for some fixed
						codes or they only allow 1 function which will work in
						recursion. But in the real world, we often use different
						functions to run the code, some of them might be using
						recursion, others may just keep calling another function
						again and again. So this website handles all those use
						cases. And it's very customizable. Like you can add as
						many functions as you want, you can add different
						languages support with ease, you can choose what you
						want to show in your recursion tree, etc.
					</p>

					<h3 class="extra-highlight">Where it can be used :</h3>
					<p>
						We can use it on our day to day basis to debug our code.
						But it can also be used by code challenge websites like
						Leetcode or code forces. The user can add his code to
						see where his code is not working. We can calculate the
						number of times a function is called with the same
						parameters and tell the user how much his algorithm can
						be improved to the same time and space complexity. We
						can calculate code efficiency with these algorithms.
